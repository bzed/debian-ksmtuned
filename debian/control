Description: enables and tunes Kernel Samepage Merging
 This package ships the ksm and ksmtuned services to control
 Kernel Samepage Merging. KSM is a memory-saving de-duplication
 feature, that merges anonymous (private) pages (not pagecache ones).
 .
 While the ksm service is only able to start and stop the KSM kernel
 thread, ksmtuned controls and tunes KSM according to the used memory
 of running qemu KVM instances.
